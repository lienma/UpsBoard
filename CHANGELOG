0.1.0
	New:
		User Account. In a future release, you'll be able to have multiple user accounts.
		SABnzbd! A semi-fully functional SABnzbd client. There are two things that I'm still working, setting the download speed and adding a nzb file. Those will come in a future release.

	Updated:
		TV Shows Airing Soon module has been updated with a new look.
		Updated Memory to allow for multiple servers. Cpu is going to be in another release.

0.0.4
	New:
		New format for total drive space in config.js file. New format is (Number)(Unit). Unit being one of the following: B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB or EB.
		Added an extra padding to bottom. Now you can see everything on a mobile device and not have the bottom bar cut off the things at the bottom of the page.
		Adding some pointer cursors to the ui.
	Fixed:
		Drives show the correct space usage.
		If the user defined a drive total space, it now shows the defined total instead of the total from the drive space.
		Fixed a bug with getting a image from plex. I had the wrong address.
		Service link now open in a new window.
		Currently watching now updates correctly.
		Recently added movies and currently watching show properly on mobile devices.

0.0.3
	New:
		New option in config.js, runningMode, You can select either "normal" or "debug"
			normal - In normal mode, your http log request would be more detailed, and it will correctly give the proper IP address, when the app is placed behind a proxy.
			debug - This mode put's UpsBoard into debugging mode, prints the html out pretty, gives basic http log requests(what file is request and how long it took to load), 
	Updates:
		Mac User's: I have the memory module return 0's for right now until I can work a better solution. This would allow the bottom bar to still function but have not results for memory.
	Fixed:
		Fixed a bug when getting an image from PMS, when it is located on a different machine.
		Fixed the drive space calculations. Now the drive spaces should be correct.

0.0.2
	New:
		Added new options to bandwidth settings:
			vnstatPath, allows you to specify the vnstat path if it is not the default location.
			vnstatDBDirectory, allows to specify the vnstat database directory, if it is not the default location
	Updates:
		Removed async module from app. Module is not used anymore.
		Changed the flow of getting the drive space. Uses df command to get drive space. But if the drive doesn't return a space, then it falls back and uses du command. The du command is not as fast as the df command.
